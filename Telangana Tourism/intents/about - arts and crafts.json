The patronage of kings and dynasties for several centuries led to a unique synthesis of various cultures, which is clearly visible in the development of a unique arts and crafts tradition in the state.\n\nBidri craft is the pride of the Telangana region. This unique art of silver engraved on metal was brought initially by Iran migrants to the region. Bidri art involves using an alloy of Copper and Zinc, called Gunmetal. Telangana is famous world-wide for its amazing Bronze castings that require exquisite skills for creating incredible idols.\n\nNirmal town is world-famous for its varied range of handicrafts made using best traditional techniques to create masterpieces. Nirmal arts involve use of natural dyes to create oil paintings, wall hangings, lacquered furniture, toys, trays, bowls, pictures, boxes and other marvellous art works of export quality. Other prominent art works of the state include Nizamabad panels, Nirmal painted furniture, Dokra castings, Silver Filigree, Cheriyal Scroll Paintings, Pembarthi brassware etc."
