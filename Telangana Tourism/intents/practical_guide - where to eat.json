Hyderabad, which was once the capital for many dynasties represents a unique blend of cuisines, beverages and culinary habits. Dum Ka Biryani, Qubani Ka Meetha, Hyderabadi special biryani, Sakinaalu, Irani Chai, Sarva Pindi are among those specialities that are popular in Hyderabad. The hinterlands of Telangana offer a much more varied cuisine experience with the local flavors and spices.
